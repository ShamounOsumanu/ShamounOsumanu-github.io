    <p> I changed the colours of my subjects face by using the threshold tool to make the photo black and white they we filled </p>
    <p>  in sections of the image with the colours that we wanted. The tools I used to complete this task were the threshold tool to make the </p>
    <p>  photo black and white. The other tool that I used was the fill tool in order to fill in certain sections of the image with the colours I wanted. </p> 
    <p>  The celebrity I chose in this photo was Hakeem Olajuwon. I chose Hakeem because he is my favourite basketball player of all time and because </p>
    <p>  I felt as if the colours of the Houston Rockets(the team he played on for 18 seasons) jersey would work well.  Hakeem is a two time NBA champion </p>
    <p>  and finals MVP.  To many African kids, Hakeem is the first example of an African succeeding on the highest level of basketball and he was a role </p>
    <p>  model for future African basketball players.
