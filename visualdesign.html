    <h2> Pop Art Celebrities    </h2>
    
    <img src = "ShamounOsumanu_portforlio/Hakeem (2).png" alt = "hakeem" width = "500" height = "500">
    
    <p> I changed the colours of my subjects face by using the threshold tool to make the photo black and white they we filled </p>
    <p>  in sections of the image with the colours that we wanted. The tools I used to complete this task were the threshold tool to make the </p>
    <p>  photo black and white. The other tool that I used was the fill tool in order to fill in certain sections of the image with the colours I wanted. </p> 
    <p>  The celebrity I chose in this photo was Hakeem Olajuwon. I chose Hakeem because he is my favourite basketball player of all time and because </p>
    <p>  I felt as if the colours of the Houston Rockets(the team he played on for 18 seasons) jersey would work well.  Hakeem is a two time NBA champion </p>
    <p>  and finals MVP.  To many African kids, Hakeem is the first example of an African succeeding on the highest level of basketball and he was a role </p>
    <p>  model for future African basketball players.
      
      
      <h2> Activisism Collage    </h2>
    
    <img src = "ShamounOsumanu_portforlio/Water Scarcity (1).png" alt = "Water Scarcity" width = "500" height = "500">
    
    <p> The social justice topic that I chose to focus on was scarcity but specifically water scarcity.  </p>
    <p>  This issue is important to me because growing up in Ghana water was something that was very expensive to buy.  </p>
    <p>  Since there wasn’t a water system like we have in the U.S we would often have to buy a huge gallon of water each month in hopes that it could last us the entire 30 days. </p> 
    <p>  The important information that I would want my audience to know is that water scarcity is primarily due to climate change and drought. </p>
    <p>   I assembled the photos the way I did because I wanted to highlight that water scarcity was a global </p>
    <p>  problem but it mostly affected people of poorer and less developed countries. </p>
      
       
      
      <h2> Fantastical Beasts   </h2>
    
    <img src = "ShamounOsumanu_portforlio/gorriwolf.png" alt = "gorriwolf" width = "500" height = "500">
      
      <p>I came up with this animal by combining my three favourite animals. </p>
       <p> The abilities that my animal would have is based on the best qualities of a gorilla, a  wolf, and a snake.</p>
       <p> From the gorilla my animal would have its intelligence and problem solving skills. </p>
       <p> It will also inherit a gorilla's brute strength. From the wolf my animal will inherit the wolf’s loyalty, speed, and sense of smell. </p>
      <p>  When it comes to the cobra, my animal will inherit the venomous aspect of a cobra, as well as its silence, and night vision. </p>
       <p> The way I turned my animals into hybrids was by using the paint tool. </p>
       <p> I painted over the parts of the animals I didn’t want to be included then I layered the</p>
       <p> photos and merged the layers together to create the final product. </p>

      <h2> Kaleidoscopes   </h2>
    
    <img src = "ShamounOsumanu_portforlio/pexels-ekaterina-kobzareva-10554102.png" alt = "Kaleidoscope" width = "500" height = "500">
      
      <p>I made this by cropping the image then duplicating it. 
        After that I used the transform tool in order to flip the image multiple times and merge the layers. 
        The image started to combine and started stacking on each other. 
        The image also looked nothing like the original image and some aspects were not the same. </p>
       
      
      <h2> Mandala   </h2>
    
    <img src = "ShamounOsumanu_portforlio/Mandela PRoject.png" alt = "Mandala" width = "500" height = "500">
      
      <p>I made this project by selecting an image and then duplicating and rotating the layers in order to make the mandela effect.
        I first set the measurements to pixels initially then I changed the resolution, height and width.
        I used a deer as my base because it is one of my favourite animals. 
        The colours I included were green and black. 
        I noticed that my shapes started to overlap each other. </p>
