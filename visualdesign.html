    <p> I changed the colours of my subjects face by using the threshold tool to make the photo black and white they we filled in sections of the image with the colours that we wanted.
      The tools I used to complete this task were the threshold tool to make the photo black and white. 
      The other tool that I used was the fill tool in order to fill in certain sections of the image with the colours I wanted. 
      The celebrity I chose in this photo was Hakeem Olajuwon. I chose Hakeem because he is my favourite basketball player of all time and because I felt as if the colours of the Houston Rockets(the team he played on for 18 seasons) jersey would work well. 
      Hakeem is a two time NBA champion and finals MVP.
      To many African kids, Hakeem is the first example of an African succeeding on the highest level of basketball and he was a role model for future African basketball players.
