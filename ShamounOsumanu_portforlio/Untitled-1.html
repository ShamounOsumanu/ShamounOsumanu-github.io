	 <h2> The Dream </h2> 
<p> Hakeem Olajuwon was an elite basketball player who played for the Houston Rockets. Hakeem was born in Nigeria on January 21st 1963. As a child, Hakeem played several sports like soccer and football. Suprisingly, he never played basketball until he was a teenager and he excelled. Hakeem then moved to Houston to attend college. Hakeem was selected as the first overall pick in the 1984 draft. This shows the raw talent that Hakeem possesed as he was selected over Michael Jordan, who many regard as the greatest basketball player of all time. Houston wasn't even questioned for picking Hakeem over Jordan because at that point he was the best player in the draft class. Hakeem then led the team to two NBA championships in back to back NBA championships.</p>
