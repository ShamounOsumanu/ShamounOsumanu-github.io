My name is Shamoun. I am 17. I attend Bronx Early College Academy for Teaching and Learning. My favourite hobby is sleeping. I want to attend college for software engineering. I then want to work for a FAANG company as a software engineer. My favourite subject in school is maths.

My main role model is Kanye West. I idolize Kanye because he is himself. My favourite artists currently are Earl Sweatshirt, Japanese Breakfast,and Haley Heynderickx. I listen to all genres of music.

My hopes and dreams for the future are very simple. I want to work at a FAANG company. I want to have my own apartment. I also want to own a farm and work at farm somewhere in the world. The most ideal place would be finland or Scandanavia. They seem like very peaceful places to spend the rest of my life in peace and solitude.
